# oimodeler

A modular modelling tool for optical interferometry


>:warning: In early development!  
>Only the oimodel is partly working with  gray and chromatic models (as shown in the image below)  

Modules:
* **oimModel** : Creation of Models with various components as bricks 
* **oimData** :  Handle interferometric, spectroscopic and photometric data
* **oimFitter** : Define an perform fitting process  
* **oimSiumlulator** : Main class holding evertyhing together and producing final results :plots, tables...
